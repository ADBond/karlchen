# Karlchen

'''Karlchen''' is a simple python package to generate `.svg` files for playing-card backs, with a few variants/options.

## Usage


## Examples

Example files were generated via

```bash
python generate_examples.py
```

That should give a reasonable idea of how to use until more detailed instructions are available.
